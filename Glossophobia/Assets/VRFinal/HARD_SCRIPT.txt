HARD SCRIPT
Every one of us recalls fond memories of childhood every once in a while.And in our memories, some of our favorite and unforgettable teachers often get into the
scene to paint a smile on our face.They have taught us the basics of surviving the ever-demanding society.And even if things weren't perfect between us and our teachers, we can never deny the fact that a part of who we are had been strongly influenced by our teachers.As Henry Adams once said, teacher affects eternity; he can never tell where his influence stops.

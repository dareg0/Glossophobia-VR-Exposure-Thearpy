Every one of us recalls fond memories of childhood every once in a while.And in our memories, some of our favorite and unforgettable teachers often get into the
scene to paint a smile on our face.They have taught us the basics of surviving the ever-demanding society.And even if things weren't perfect between us and our teachers, we can never deny the fact that a part of who we are had been strongly influenced by our teachers.As Henry Adams once said, teacher affects eternity; he can never tell where his influence stops.
Yet, they don't seem to get the respect they deserve from this nation. Why do I say that? Just take a look at their average salary.It is true that most teachers get into the profession of teaching for reasons nobler than monetary benefits. But that doesn’t mean they should not be compensated well.Let me give you three reasons why teachers definitely deserve a raise. First, let's look at the most practical side of the issue.The New Teacher Project (TNTP) estimates that over 10,000 of the nation’s highest performing teachers leave the classroom every year and among the reasons is low compensation.In fact, one million American teachers are projected to leave their profession in the next several years.Once these teachers leave, we also lose the chance of developing experience among these professionals.Furthermore, the cost of attrition would range from five billion dollars to over seven billion per year.

Our project involves tackling an issue which troubles around 10 percent of all Americans - phobias.
We hope to provide a solution using virtual reality for people with glossophobic disorders rooted in visual stimuli.
This VR tool will enable users to expose themselves to an auditorium with control over their environment.
The user will be able to control visual triggers such as the number of people in the audience, the brightness of the lights, etc.
We also would like the user to have the option to pick up the microphone if they want,
and have access to subtitles for a speech if they need it to practice.
We will be using an oculus quest as our tool for this exposure therapy mechanism.
The initial goal for our project is to target visual senses and to provide an experience
where people with glossophobia can expose themselves to an auditorium of people,
however if we have time we will continue to develop the product to get questions from audiences
and negative reactions from audiences to make the experience more realistic.
In order to do this we will include headphones built into the oculus as our secondary display for audio.

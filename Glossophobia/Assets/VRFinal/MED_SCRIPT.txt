So let's say you want to become rich, famous, and adored by a vast majority of the world. You've got some options. 
You could write a great book. You could play the lead for an expensive movie. Or you could become a rock star.
While it's unlikely that you'll ever do any of those things and become rich and famous 
but each of those things on their own add an incredible amount of value to your own life personally
Today, I want to tell you why everyone should learn to play an instrument if they want to better themselves.
Playing an instrument improves your physical control and well-being. 
Instruments require varying levels of both stamina and physical prowess to play.
If you've ever been to a concert and watched the drummer, you've seen this in action -- 
by the end of the first two songs, most drummers are drenched in sweat.
Researchers from the University of Chichester found that touring drummers burn an average of 300 calories per hour, 
and lose a quart of body fluids in that same timeframe.
Drumming might be an extreme example, but playing any instrument while standing strains your whole body. 
Playing an instrument also improves your coordination.
